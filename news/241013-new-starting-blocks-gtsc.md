It has been many years in the making but we are so pleased to say that we finally have the correct diving blocks in place at the Gloucester Olympic Pool. 

We would like to thank our Diamond Sponsors and Mid Coast Council who helped make this happen. 

Look out Feb 22nd, 2025 when we can finally hold our first official Qualifying Carnival.
