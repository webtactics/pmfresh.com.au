Please save the date; it is time to celebrate what our children have achieved this year. 

Our annual presentation will be held in the <a href="https://clubgloucester.com.au/" title="top bar section of Club Gloucester" target="_blank">top bar section of Club Gloucester</a>.

Grab your dinner from the Chinese below and bring it up with you. 

The BAR will be open upstairs, so grab a drink or 2 and get ready for the AGM that will be on straight after the presentation. 

All positions will be declared open so it will be a great opportunity for anyone to be a part of the committee for the 2025/2026 season
