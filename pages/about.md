## Gloucester Thunderbolts Swimming Club (GTSC) is a small community club providing opportunities for swimmers of all levels to improve their swimming and achieve personal goals. 

We are a family oriented club offering a friendly and relaxed environment for all swimmers, both young and old. Racing is against swimmers of similar ability, not age, and the focus is on improving your own best time.

Gloucester Thunderbolts Swimming Club runs from mid Oct till early April on Thursday evenings at 6.00pm at the Gloucester Pool Complex. 

All ages and abilities are welcome.
