**Swimming is a good all-round activity with many health benefits and club nights provide a friendly social environment for swimmers and their families.**

**Why wouldn't you want to be involved?**

At Gloucester Thunderbolts Swimming Club we provide opportunities for swimmers of all levels to improve their swimming and achieve personal goals. We are a family friendly club offering a friendly and relaxed environment for all swimmers, both young and old. 

### How our club night works:

Held on Thursday nights it typically starts at 6pm and finishes by about 8pm. Club Nights begin mid-October and run approximately till the end of March.

Swimmers are required to nominate for each weeks events via Swim Central. Entries open on Friday mornings and you have until Wednesday afternoons each week to get your entries in.

To nominate for club night you must be a Gloucester Thunderbolts Swimming Club member.

If you would like to trial for two weeks prior to registering just email your or your child's details including full name, DOB and what events you would like to enter in to  [gloucesterthunderboltsswimclub@outlook.com](mailto:gloucesterthunderboltsswimclub@outlook.com) before 4pm Wednesday.

Races are organised according to swimmers' times; this is to help provide an opportunity for swimmers of all ages to compete against each other with the swimmers aim being to beat their personal best times each week. 

We rely on our parents to be active in running each club night, especially with setting up the lane ropes, time-keeping duties, marshalling and the end of night pack up. These activities are a great way to meet fellow parents and ensures that club nights operate smoothly.

Gloucester Thunderbolts welcome you and your family to our club and look forward to seeing you at the pool.

### Membership

The Club Membership Fees for the 2024/2025 season have been set by the club committee and the fees set by Swimming Australia / Swimming NSW / Swimming North Coast.

Registrations for the 2024/2025 swim season are now open.  

The committee has continued to try and keep club fees as low as possible, to encourage families to join and participate in our club. Our club requires that at least one parent/carer for swimmers under the age of 18 are registered (as a swimmer or dry member) as this allows for them to be covered by the Swimming Australia Insurance and gives minors a voice within the club.

Fees are based on the set fee structure provided by Swimming Australia, Swimming NSW and Swimming North Coast and Swim Central. Our club committee adds a small portion to help with club running expenses.  A full breakdown of these memberships can be found here.

**The memberships and corresponding fees our club will offer this year are as follows:**

$41.00: Dry member (Parent / Guardian / Non swimmer / Committee Members)

$100.00: Club swimmer (Swimmers who only compete at club night)

$120.00: Competitive swimmer (Swimmers who compete at meets state-wide)

$30.00: Second claim member (Swimmers who hold a full membership with another swim club but wish to participate at our club nights)
