        <p>At PMFresh, our philosophy is built on the four pillars below. It is what drives our actions and what we stand behind.</p>
        <p><strong>People First</strong><br>
        We treat our colleagues as family and respect our partners as friends. We listen and care about the opinions offered to us and understand the needs of others. We consider quality, freshness and the goodness that we can bring to others.</p>
        <p><strong>Globally Aware</strong><br>
        We keep abreast of and source the best global innovations in products, packaging formats and seasonal trends. We are aheadof the curve and excited about trying new things. We believe that’s where the fresh thinking happens.</p>
        <p><strong>Excellence</strong><br>
        We strive for the highest standard in everything we do. Success is what we strive for. Our intention is to bring unparalleled goodness to the lives we come in contact with.</p>
        <p><strong>Solution Focused</strong><br>
          We develop pragmatic, commercially-viable solutions. We do not focus on the issues, rather, we put our energy into how we can move forward and make great things happen.</p>
